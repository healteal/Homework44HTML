        </font>
        Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
        Where civil blood makes civel hands unclean.<br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
        Whose misadventure piteous overthows<br>
        Do with their death bury their parents strife.<br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love<br>
        And the continuance of their parents rage<br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
        Is now the two hours traffic of our stage;<br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

        Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

        No, for then we should be colliers.
